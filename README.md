This project works on an open‐source AI framework for automated brain segmentation, abnormality
detection, and statistical analysis in neuroimaging. A U-Net architecture was used, and training was
done on open-source CT scans and respective segmentation masks to detect intracranial hemorrhages.
The model achieved high sensitivity in detecting hemorrhagic regions, as shown in training metrics and
significant performance improvements (p < 0.05) were seen compared to baseline methods. Qualitative
evaluations and quantitative tests such as t-tests and ANOVA shows us the model’s clinical potential for
rapid and accurate diagnostic support as well.

Problem statement :
Manual interpretation of CT scans can be time-consuming and subject to human error. Automated tools
can assist radiologists by instantly detecting and localising hemorrhagic regions.

Goal :
The goal of this project was to develop and validate an open‐source deep learning model for multi-class
brain segmentation and hemorrhage detection using CT images. And statistical analysis using t-tests and
ANOVA to validate model performance.
